This blog is only a place for me to work out my thoughts in public, in a place I can point colleagues to as needed. 

I am a software engineer focused primarily on embedded Linux, device firmware, and new ways to address old problems.

"12 Scorpio" is a Sabian symbol; the symbol is "An Embassy Ball" and is often assumed to reference the book Master and Margarita. It is also the degree of my mercury, the glyph associated with thinking, and Master and Margarita-themed things became a repeating motif in my personal infrastruture.
