This is not a "blog". What a terrible word to inflict on the world! This is not a sales pitch, a tutorial site, or free labor in hopes of landing a job. 

While there are a lot of (likely boring and nuanced, to most people) opinions here, which may be mildly controversial to a tiny slice of computer people, this is not a place of Opinions. This is not a place of wanking, whining, whinging, or ranting. 

This is not really a place to stir discussion. I don't care about the opinions of most, even relevant to my work; there are no comments here, no hope for a greater collaboration with strangers.

What this is, is a place for me to think in public on matters related to my software and hardware work. I will make no effort to make my work trackable to outsiders, or to project manage my work publicly, or to translate higher- or lower- level details to different audiences. I will not attempt to 'build an audience' or 'drive engagement' on my at-times scattered or overly-pedantic thoughts. This is just a place for me to think out loud and, occasionally, share those thoughts with colleagues.
