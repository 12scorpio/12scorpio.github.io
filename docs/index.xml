      <description>This is not a &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;. What a terrible word to inflict on the world! This is not a sales pitch, a tutorial site, or free labor in hopes of landing a job.
While there are a lot of (likely boring and nuanced, to most people) opinions here, which may be mildly controversial to a tiny slice of computer people, this is not a place of Opinions. This is not a place of wanking, whining, whinging, or ranting.</description>

      <description>This blog is only a place for me to work out my thoughts in public, in a place I can point colleagues to as needed.
I am a software engineer focused primarily on embedded Linux, device firmware, and new ways to address old problems.
&amp;ldquo;12 Scorpio&amp;rdquo; is a Sabian symbol; the symbol is &amp;ldquo;An Embassy Ball&amp;rdquo; and is often assumed to reference the book Master and Margarita. It is also the degree of my mercury, the glyph associated with thinking, and Master and Margarita-themed things became a repeating motif in my personal infrastruture.</description>
