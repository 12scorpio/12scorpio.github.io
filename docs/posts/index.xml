      <description>This is not a &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;. What a terrible word to inflict on the world! This is not a sales pitch, a tutorial site, or free labor in hopes of landing a job.
While there are a lot of (likely boring and nuanced, to most people) opinions here, which may be mildly controversial to a tiny slice of computer people, this is not a place of Opinions. This is not a place of wanking, whining, whinging, or ranting.</description>
